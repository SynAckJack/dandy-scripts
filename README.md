# dandy-scripts
Some super scratched scripts that I've somehow put together.

## ciphersuite.py
_Using the output from testssl.sh, query https://ciphersuite.info for the security rating of each._

## generatehex.py
_Display hex ranging from \x00 to \xff._

## pihole.sh
_Get some stats from a local-network based pihole._
